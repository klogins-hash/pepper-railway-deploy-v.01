- **Peer-reviewed research** from medical/psychological journals
- **Clinical resources** from established ADHD/psychology organizations
- **Professional sources** on business partnership models
- **Design research** on voice AI accessibility
- **Community insights** from neurodivergent populations

### Quality Criteria

- Interaction effects of ADHD + INFJ combination in business settings
